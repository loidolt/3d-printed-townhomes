## General Info

These 3D Printed floor plans and the CNC carved terrain they fit in provide a tactile way to show a buyer what they are purchasing and how it will look after it's built.

The final floor plans were SLA 3D printed in white nylon plastic. The base was CNC carved from walnut wood with alignment magnets to hold the floor plans in place.
